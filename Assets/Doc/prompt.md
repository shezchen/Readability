## Day 1

你是一位经验丰富的游戏文案策划，擅长新怪谈风格的游戏文案创作。
现在，我正在开发一款心理恐怖风格的剧情解谜游戏。游戏的主题比较离奇怪异，有着一定的新怪谈主义+元叙事+规则怪谈+大卫林奇心理恐怖风格。我需要向游戏中加入四篇文案，这四篇文案中需要体现出游戏世界观中的下列信息：

1.“安眠药”是一种奇怪的药物，应当被谨慎使用，它似乎并不是催眠，带有某种隐秘的可怕副作用。
2.有人曾经因为在一小时连续复用“安眠药”而出现了可怕的副作用。
3.“安眠药”与氟伏沙明混用时，效果会减弱。
4.在服用“安眠药”之后绝不应该尝试记忆信息。
5.几乎所有服用过“安眠药”的人都不承认他们服用过“安眠药”，也没有相关记忆。
6.千万不要和近期服用过“安眠药”的人谈论最近的生活，否则会激发他们关于“服用过“安眠药””的深层记忆。

这六条信息不应该被直接展示在玩家眼前（注意，这是一款剧情解谜游戏），而是由玩家仔细阅读这四篇文章，从中搜寻线索，并思考推理得出结论。

你的写作文风可以参考“SCP基金会”的档案风格，使用极其写实，强调科学、理性的风格阐述一种未知的恐惧。
下面是一段示例：
SCP-102 is a mansion located at ██ █████ ████ ██████████, currently maintained by the shell corporation known as Ghieser Housing Associates. It is marketed as a "weeklong stay for those with tastes in the invisible adventures of privileged life", primarily through the use of online advertisements targeting impulsive high net-worth spenders.
Booking a stay at SCP-102 will cause a key to manifest in the pocket of the payor. When a person who is not the keyholder enters SCP-102, its interior appears as that of a severely dilapidated home damaged by rust, dry rot, and termites. However, when the keyholder enters via unlocking the front door, they will find themselves in a tidy, well-kept interior, decorated following suburban design trends from the 1960s.
Remaining in SCP-102 as the keyholder for more than one hour causes said keyholder to become capable of at-will invisibility and intangibility, allowing them to move through objects unimpeded. This effect lasts for the duration of their stay or until they leave SCP-102 for more than a day, whether by their own choice or through being forcibly removed. Staying invisible for longer than the duration of their stay removes the effect of intangibility, an event detectable by the ██ thaumic sensors installed inside of SCP-102 by GoI-012.3
Addendum.102.01: On August 12th, 1989, an unusual radio signal was detected emanating from SCP-102. Upon analysis, the signal was determined to originate from SCP-102’s current resident, undetectable by the wider population due to being tuned to an impossible radio station.4 The signal transcripts have been provided below, as they give context into how a keyholder could interact with and utilize SCP-102’s capabilities.

你可以参考这种新怪谈文风，但是使用简体中文。控制篇幅，每一篇在2000~4000字。这六条线索应当随意分布在所有4篇文档之内。

好的，现在请你先不要开始写作，告诉我你的写作计划和灵感。（关于“我想写什么、怎么写”）
